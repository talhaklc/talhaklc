#### 🎓 Sharing Knowledge

I’m also passionate about **teaching**. I create educational content on **Big Data, Data Sciense, Artificial Intelligence Technologies** through platforms like **Udemy** and **BTK Akademi**. 

- 🎥 My video courses simplify complex Big Data concepts
- 🎉 Over **150,000 students** have enrolled
- 💼 Many of them landed jobs after completing the courses

It's incredibly rewarding to contribute to others' learning journeys.
